`public/extras.js` adapts these Swift policies to JavaScript:

- `Sources/Heeler/Snippets/Snippet.swift`: optional title, 4,000-character body limit, newline normalization, control-character rejection.
- `Sources/Heeler/Terminal/TerminalTextSafety.swift`: accepted text controls and CRLF/CR normalization.
- `Sources/Heeler/Terminal/TerminalScreenView.swift`, `TerminalLinkPolicy`: permit ordinary HTTP(S) destinations only. This adaptation additionally rejects embedded credentials.

Browser-specific implementations are informed by `SnippetStore.swift`, `AttachLinkIndex.swift`, and `AttachUserMessageIndex.swift`: preserve unreadable saved catalogs, stable snippet order, per-terminal memory-only links, OSC 8 destination handling, and prompt-glyph history targets.

Changes: browser localStorage instead of UserDefaults; JavaScript UTF-16 length limits; links scan complete bridge snapshots rather than incremental PTY chunks; message jumps navigate loaded xterm rows without sending remote input. No Swift, SSH, ActivityKit or libghostty runtime was copied. Native iOS Live Activities are not provided by these web features.
